                          <p>Homeopathy, also known as homeopathic medicine, is a medical system that was developed in Germany more than 200 years ago.</p>
                          <p>In today's conventional practice, the physician spends very little time with the patient. It is of utmost importance that the doctor, gives a patient hearing to the person ailing, spends some time to discuss about his illness and understands the suffering of the individual seeking treatment.</p>
                          <p>Homoeopathy is a holistic science, which renders cure and healing, rather than mere alleviation of disease, and takes into consideration the minutest details of the ailing person. In order to do this, a Homoeopathic physician needs to spend a substantial amount of time with the patient and understand several aspects about him and his life.</p>
                          <p>During the process of Homoeopathic case taking, he not only enquires about the physical ailments in detail but also questions about his general state of health, illnesses in the past and family, his life situation, anxieties and stress, fears, dreams etc. This helps the physician to perceive the diseased person in totality, thereby enabling him to find the right Homoeopathic Similimum for the patient. It also helps the patient to repose trust in his physician and develop a good rapport with him.</p>
